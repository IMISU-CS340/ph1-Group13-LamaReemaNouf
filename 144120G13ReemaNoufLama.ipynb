introduction :\n","\n","\n","searching Algorithm is important field in AI used to check or retrieve element form any data structure.In searching algorithm we foucs to find a particular solution without passing over all possible solution. \n","So, search algorithm: is the process of navigating from starting state to a goal state by transitioning through intermediate states.\n","the process of chooseing the move(action) depends on the algorithm.\n","\n","\n","we will disscuss 2 of these algorithms :\n","\n","\n","1- A*.\n","\n","\n","2- simulated annealing.\n","\n","\n","before we start the algorithm we need to formlate the problem because it makes you well aware of the tasks that you have to perform in order to accomplish the search.\n","\n","\n","#### Problem formulation:\n","\n","**Initial state:** when the algorithm is running the initial state is the current state.\n","\n","\n","**Actions:** all possible moves that can be done in state.\n","\n","\n","**Transition model:** A description of what each action does.\n","\n","\n","**State space:** set of states can be generated from initial state.\n","\n","\n","**Goal test:** subset from state space we want to reach it.\n","\n","\n","\n","#### Inform search :\n","\n","\n","### part one A*:\n","\n","\n","#####  Heuristic function :\n","It’s a function that estimates the actual cost to decide which states leads to goal.\n","There are many ways to calculate the heuristic function.\n","\n","\n","\n","##### A* : \n","A searching algorithm gives the best path in graph by using a function of heuristic h(n) + actual cost g(n) to avoid the expanding of expensive path.  \n","\n","\n","Let’s apply A* algorithm in maze problem:\n"," \n"," \n","The maze is made of 4x4 squares; we have three types of squares:\n","\n","\n","1-\tGreen square represents legal move.\n","\n","\n","2-\tRed square represents a wall (can’t move throw it).\n","\n","\n","3-\tGray represents fixed place of start and end.\n","\n","\n","\n","And you have 4 actions: left, right, up, down.\n","\n","\n","\n","Our goal is to reach the end with minimum number of moves.\n","\n","\n","\n","##### Problem
